## What is Getlnk?

Getlnk is an **open-source** link-in-bio platform that lets you create a single,
shareable landing page with all your links. Unlike proprietary alternatives
(Linktree, etc.), you own your data and can self-host for free.

**Example:** `getlnk.xyz/@yourname`

### Why Getlnk?

- 🔓 **Open Source** - Own your data, customize everything
- 💰 **Affordable** - Free tier, Pro at $5/mo (coming soon)
- 🚀 **Fast & Modern** - Built with Deno + Fresh
- 🎨 **Beautiful Themes** - 5+ themes, more coming
- 📊 **Analytics Built-in** - Track views and clicks
- 🔒 **Privacy-First** - No tracking, no ads

## Self-Hosted & Open Source

Unlike other link-in-bio tools, Getlnk is **100% open source**. Host it
yourself, customize it, and own your data.
